# Speech Synthesis Interruption Fix

## Issue Fixed ✅

**Error**: `Speech synthesis error: interrupted`
**Location**: `utterance.onerror` in `js/anne-tts-enhanced.js:243`

## Root Cause 🔍
The error occurred when:
1. A new speech synthesis request was made while another was still playing
2. The browser automatically interrupted the previous speech
3. The error handler treated "interrupted" as a fatal error instead of normal behavior

## Solutions Applied 🔧

### 1. **Enhanced Error Handling**
Updated the `onerror` handler to treat interruption gracefully:

```javascript
} else if (event.error === 'interrupted' || event.error === 'canceled') {
    console.log('🎤 Speech synthesis was interrupted, this is normal');
    resolve(false); // Treat interruption as successful completion
}
```

### 2. **Prevention of Conflicts**
Added a 50ms delay after stopping previous speech before starting new speech:

```javascript
this.stop(); // Stop any current speech

// Small delay to prevent conflicts with stopped speech
setTimeout(() => {
    const utterance = new SpeechSynthesisUtterance(text);
    // ... rest of speech synthesis code
}, 50);
```

### 3. **Comprehensive Error Types**
Now handles all common speech synthesis errors gracefully:
- `not-allowed` / `permission-denied` → Fall back to sample voices
- `interrupted` / `canceled` → Treat as normal (not an error)
- `network` / `synthesis-failed` → Fall back to sample voices
- Unknown errors → Be lenient, don't crash

## Results 📊

✅ **No more interruption errors** - handled gracefully
✅ **Smoother speech transitions** - 50ms delay prevents conflicts
✅ **Better user experience** - no error messages for normal interruptions
✅ **Robust fallback system** - all error types handled appropriately
✅ **System stability** - speech engine doesn't crash on interruptions

## Technical Details 🛠️

The fix ensures that:
1. **Speech interruption is normal behavior** when new speech starts
2. **Timing conflicts are minimized** with the 50ms delay
3. **Error handling is comprehensive** for all speech synthesis error types
4. **System remains functional** even when speech is interrupted frequently

This creates a much more stable and user-friendly TTS experience!

# TTS Error Fix Summary

## Issue Identified
The original error was caused by the TTS engine trying to connect to `localhost:3001` in a cloud environment where the backend server is not available.

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Environment Detection
- Added `isLocalEnvironment()` method to detect if running locally vs cloud
- Added `detectServerUrl()` method to set appropriate server URL
- Added `isCloudEnvironment` property to track environment

### 2. Graceful Fallback
- Modified `checkAvailability()` to return `false` immediately in cloud environments
- Added timeout handling for local server checks (3 seconds)
- Improved error messages for different failure scenarios

### 3. Safe TTS Function
- Created `safeTTSSpeak()` helper function to safely call TTS throughout the app
- Added try-catch error handling for all TTS operations
- Replaced all direct `ttsEngine.speak()` calls with the safe version

### 4. Better Status Management
- Enhanced `updateTTSStatus()` function with proper error handling
- Added cloud-specific status messages
- Improved TTS control panel state management

### 5. Error Prevention
- Added proper null checks before making fetch requests
- Implemented AbortController for request timeouts
- Added graceful degradation when TTS is unavailable

## Result
The application now:
- ✅ Loads without errors in cloud environments
- ✅ Properly detects when TTS is unavailable
- ✅ Shows appropriate status messages
- ✅ Falls back to text-only mode gracefully
- ✅ Maintains full functionality for chat and personality switching
- ✅ Works perfectly in local environments when TTS server is available

## Key Changes Made
1. **js/anne-tts-engine.js**: Added environment detection and graceful fallbacks
2. **anne-enhanced.js**: Replaced all TTS calls with safe helper function
3. **Error handling**: Added comprehensive try-catch blocks and timeouts
4. **Status management**: Enhanced UI status updates and error reporting

The TTS system now properly handles both local and cloud environments without throwing errors.
